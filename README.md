# ovirtscripts
# The OVIRT_INFORMATIONAL.sh is a simple script that uses curl to make GET requests for information from the ovirt API
# Currently it is coded in such a way that you need to use the internal admin account and password to "use" the script.
# If you are not comfortable with the code in this script do not run this code, however I can assure you it does not actually do anything at this time. It however can easily be converted to start doing things like shutting down or starting vms. Albeit in a not so effcient fashion. 
# I wrote this script mainly as a practice script to learn about ovirt and increase my skills with bash scripting, this is by no means meant to enhance any particular part of the oVirt experience.
